    "The EPR method investigates the resonant absorption of an alternating electromagnetic field in a sample depending on the external conditions controlled by the experimenter: a constant magnetic field, the frequency of oscillations of the alternating field and temperature.\n",

    "The simplest model for considering EPR is a system of non-interacting particles with spin $S = 1/2$ placed in an external magnetic field. In the absence of a magnetic field, the energies of the states with the spin projection $S_Z = \\pm 1/2$ coincide. Due to the Zeeman effect, the energies of states with different spin projections begin to differ. If we direct a radiation stream with an energy equal to the difference in the energies of these states to our system\n",

    "then induced transitions between states will become possible. These transitions occur with the absorption or emission of a photon, depending on which of the states the system was in before interacting with radiation. In contrast to optical transitions between electronic energy levels in an atom, the typical frequency of the alternating field in the EPR experiment is about 10 GHz, which corresponds to a photon energy of less than 1K. Therefore, with the exception of very low temperatures, the population of both spin sublevels with $S_Z = \\ pm 1/2$ is close. In the state of thermal equilibrium, the lower energy level is more populated, therefore, the absorption of electromagnetic radiation is observed.\n",

    "The\" classical \" approach considers the precession of the magnetic moment in an external field when the magnetic moment deviates from equilibrium. The classical magnetic dipole tends to align along the magnetic field lines, when it deviates from equilibrium, a returning mechanical moment $\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{M}\\times \\mathbf{B}$occurs. Since the magnetic and mechanical moment of an ion are related to each other by the gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ as $\\mathbf{M}=\\gamma \\mathbf{J}$, where $\\mathbf{J}$ is the total angular momentum, then taking into account the dynamics equation\n",
    "$\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{T}$, we get the equation of the precession of the magnetic moment\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\mathbf{M} = \\gamma \\mathbf{M} \\times \\mathbf{B}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, with the well-known gyroscope precession problem, it can be noted that when the magnetic moment deviates from the direction of the magnetic field, an undamped precession occurs around the direction of the field with an angular velocity $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} = - \\gamma \\mathbf{B}$, the frequency of this precession $\\Omega_L = \\gamma B$ is called Larmor. If the frequency of the alternating field perpendicular to the main field coincides with the Larmor frequency, resonant absorption may occur.\n",

    "In the quantum mechanical method of description, the structure of the terms of atoms (ions or molecules) split in a magnetic field and the transitions between the split sublevels are considered. To avoid confusion, we note that the EPR differs from the optical Zeeman effect, which is discussed in sufficient detail in the course of general physics. In the case of the optical Zeeman effect, a splitting of the spectral line associated with transitions between different atomic terms is observed in the magnetic field. The frequency of this spectral line usually lies in the optical range. Frequency of the alternating electromagnetic field\n",
